// *Question 48:* Combining Arrays with Spread Operator: Suppose you're comparing prices of two different sets of laptops. Use the spread operator to combine these arrays into a single array sorted in ascending order, then log the result.

//*Explain & TIP:* The spread operator can be used in conjunction with array methods like sort() to combine and manipulate arrays efficiently.
let pricesSet1 = [1200, 1500, 1100];
let pricesSet2 = [1000, 1300, 1600];
let combinedPrices = [...pricesSet1, ...pricesSet2].sort((a, b) => a - b);
console.log(combinedPrices);
